# Open Energy Data

A list of energy-related datasets provided as [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io) with a focus on Switzerland and neighbouring regions.

This list is maintained by the [Opendata.ch](http://opendata.ch) community through the [Open Energy Data](https://energy.opendata.ch/) working group. The metadata was collected by us through web searches and public contributions, and is provided as "best effort", without any guarantee of correctness.
