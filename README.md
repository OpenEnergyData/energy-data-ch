# Open Energy Data

A list of energy-related open datasets provided as [Simple Data Format Data Packages](http://dataprotocols.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simple-data-format.html), compiled by [Opendata.ch](http://opendata.ch) in preparation for the [Open Energy Data Hackdays](https://opendata.ch/projects/energy-data-hackdays-2019/). The metadata was collected by us through web searches and public contributions, and is provided as "best effort", without any guarantee of correctness.

To add new datasets or make modifications, please see the [master list](https://airtable.com/shr3ZVzEUlxS2JRLu) and [suggest new datasets](https://airtable.com/shrykWVriVLuRzZ9I) to open up using Airtable.
